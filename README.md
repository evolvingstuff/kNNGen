Experimenting with some of the ideas in this paper:

[Generalization through Memorization: Nearest Neighbor Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00172)

and later might incorporate ideas from this paper as well:

[Infini-gram: Scaling Unbounded n-gram Language Models to a Trillion Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17377)

### Setup

Create a `.env` file, and inside of it add your HuggingFace API token, like so:

```
HF_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_api_token_here
```

*Or* add the equivalent to your system's environment variables.
